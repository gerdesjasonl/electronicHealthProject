  ## Description
  Our project is a secure and user-friendly Electronic Health Record (EHR) system designed to enhance communication between patients and family doctors. The platform enables:Patients to connect with their family doctors, view their profile and health records, and receive personalized health tips.Doctors to access their profile, manage patient details, and provide medical feedback using an external API for health insights. Built with PostgresQL, Express, React, Node.js, JWT authentication, and TypeScript. We utilized Bootstrapp CSS for styles and Cloudinary for profile image uploads and hosting. The health information dropdown in the Doctor profile page is populated through an open API developed by the OASH (Office of Assistant Secretary of Health) in the US department of Health and Human services.
